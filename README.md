# bikeshare-script-data-explore
Exploring US bikshare data through your terminal

The goal of this project is to make use of Python to epxlore data related to bike share systems for these cities in the US - Chicago, New York City, and Washington.


I can't upload the dataset from these cities (chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, and washington.csv) because of their weight.


I have used descriptive statistics to explore data and get relevant info and I have written a script to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present the statistics.


In the interactive experience you can filter by city, month, and day of the week to get customized statistics.
The information, about the use of bicycles, you will get will be related with:
* time: most common month, day of week and start hour.
* bicycle stations: most used start and end stations and most frequent combination of start and end stations trip.
* trip duration: total travel time by all users and the average travel time of the user.
* information about the user: subscriber or customer, gender, and birth year (gender and birth year wonâ€™t be available for Washington).
